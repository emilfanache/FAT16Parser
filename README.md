# FAT16Parser

This is a FAT16 Parser implemented in Python. Initial purpose was for it to parse a corrupted partition of a drive. There are other parsers online,<br/>
but I needed an implementation that's maybe a bit more descriptive.


## Requirements
Python3

## Quick start
First of all make sure you have the right permission to run the script. It needs the drive path and the offset for the FAT partition<br/>
If the offset is not specified it will be set to 0. You can specify the offset in 2 ways:<br/>
    - by specifying the number of bytes
        sudo python3 main.py -f /dev/sda -b 8388608
    - by specifying the number of sectors and the number of bytes per sector
        sudo python3 main.py -f /dev/sda -s 16384 -l 512
        # by default sector size is 512
        sudo python3 main.py -f /dev/sda -s 16384


## Limitations
In theory it should work with FAT & FAT32, not just FAT16, but I didn't test it further.
